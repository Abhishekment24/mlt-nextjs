            <p className="">
              OTC trading is a private and direct transaction between two
              parties that operates outside of a centralized exchange.
            </p>
            <p className="">
              This allows for greater flexibility in the negotiation of prices
              and terms between the two parties, and enables the execution of
              larger trades that may not be possible on traditional exchanges
              due to the limitations of the exchange&apos;s order book and liquidity.
              Additionally, OTC trading is often used to achieve privacy and
              confidentiality, as trades are not publicly disclosed like they
              are on an exchange.
            </p>
            <p className="">
              According to some estimates, the daily volume of cryptocurrency
              OTC trading is higher than that of most major exchanges. In April
              2018, TABB Group and Digital Assets Research found that the OTC
              market saw $250 million to $30 billion in daily trades, while
              exchanges saw around $15 billion in trades. This indicates that
              OTC trading has significant liquidity and is a major contributor
              to the overall crypto market.
