                      Buyers browse the marketplace and select the NFTs they

                      of the NFT deducted from their cryptocurrency balance.

                    <li>
                      Once a purchase is made, the NFT is transferred to the

                      seller sets the price for the NFT, and the transaction is
                      processed in a similar way to the original purchase.
